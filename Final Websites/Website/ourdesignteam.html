            <h3> About the design team </h3>
            <p> I’m Carrie Shaw and I currently attend University of Illinois at Chicago where I am a graduate student in the Biomedical Visualization program.  I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Public Health and a minor in Chemistry.  To follow my interest in global public health, I decided to become a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic where  my job was to teach family nutrition to mothers and reproductive health to youth, with the goal of increasing public health knowledge in rural Dominican communities.  My passion for art as a way to communicate health information continued to grow and that’s when I found out about the field of medical illustration.  I have always loved both science and art and feel very fortunate to have found my way into a career that will allow me to spend my days doing what I love most!</p>
